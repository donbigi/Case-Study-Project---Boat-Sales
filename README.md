# Case-Study-Project---Boat-Sales
 
<p style="text-align: justify;">
          I assumed I work as a data analyst for a yacht and boat sales website.
          The marketing team is preparing a weekly newsletter for boat owners.
          The newsletter is designed to help sellers to get more views of their
          boat, as well as stay on top of market trends.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
          They want me to look at the recent data and help them learn more about
          the characteristics of the most viewed boat listings in the last 7
          days - is it the most expensive boats that get the most views? Are
          there common features among the most viewed boats?
        </p>
